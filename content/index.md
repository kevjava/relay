# Welcome to Relay

Relay is a lightweight PHP content management system designed for simplicity and security.

## Getting Started

- Content is managed through Markdown files in the `/content` directory
- Menus can be edited through the admin interface at `/admin.php`
- Users are managed via CLI tools: `php admin-tools.php`

## Features

- **Markdown Support**: Write content in simple Markdown format
- **Frontmatter**: Add metadata to pages using YAML-style frontmatter
- **Multiple Menus**: Header, left sidebar, and right sidebar navigation
- **Secure**: CSRF protection, rate limiting, and secure password hashing
- **No Database**: All data stored in JSON and Markdown files

## Administration

Log in to the [admin panel](/admin.php) to manage menus and change your password.
